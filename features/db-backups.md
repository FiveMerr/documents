Enter an easy to remember name for your reference. Use your RP server name.\
\
MySQL Host: \
This is your server IP's where your database is hosted (where xampp or MySQL installation is at)\
\
MySQL Port: \
Default port is usually 3306 but you may have a custom one. You will need to open these ports from your firewall to allow the connection. If you need to learn how to open your ports, you can visit [this](https://docs.1of1servers.com/1-of-1-knowledge-base/opening-your-ports) article to learn. You need to open port 3306 TCP incoming only. \
\
DO NOT OPEN YOUR PORTS WITHOUT ADDING A PASSWORD TO YOUR DATABASE OR ANYONE CAN SIMPLY JUST LOG INTO YOUR DATABASE.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

MySQL User: \
This is usually located on your FiveM server.cfg on the `mysql_connection_string` of your server.cfg by default it is usually root unless changed.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
MySQL Password: \
Your password for your database, usually this is set as no password therefore you need to set a password for your database. \
\
DO NOT OPEN YOUR PORTS WITHOUT ADDING A PASSWORD TO YOUR DATABASE OR ANYONE CAN SIMPLY JUST LOG INTO YOUR DATABASE. \
\
To add a password to your database open your database command prompt and run the below, replace `MyNewPasswordGoesHere` for the password you want to set on your server.\
\
Your server.cfg should then look something like this:&#x20;

```properties
set mysql_connection_string "mysql://root:MyNewPasswordGoesHere@localhost/QBCoreFramework_6EA45D?charset=utf8mb4"
```
{% endhint %}

```sql
SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('MyNewPasswordGoesHere'); FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
