## Custom Logging

You may use `fm-logs` to leverage custom reporting to Fivemerr by using the following export function:

```
-- Example of a createLog function
exports['fm-logs']:createLog({
    LogType = "Player", -- The log type, must be defined in Config.Logs
    Message = "Player action here", -- The message of the log
    Level = "info", -- The level of the log (can be filtered on Fivemerr) (info by default)
    Resource = "script-name", -- Resource where the log is coming from (If not provided, `fm-logs` will be set by default)
    Source = 1, -- Server id for player (Required for Player Attributes to be pulled)
    Metadata = {} -- Custom attributes to be added
})
```

The export can be used on both server and client sides.

## Framework Support

This logger does not require a framework, however, if you use QBCore or ESX, you can set these in the config to display the player's character name in the logs on Fivemerr. Setting a framework will also enable the "playerConnected" log in the spawn logs as it will listen to the player loaded event based on the framework specified.

```
Framework = "qb", -- "qb" | "esx" | "standalone"
```

If you do not use a framework, simply set this to "standalone".
